# The Epic QR Generator

[My Notes](notes.md)

This is a QR code generator that will let you put your own logo in the center!


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

### Key features

- Ability to generate a QR code
- Ability to have that QR code with your logo
- Saves past QR codes that you have made on your account

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Will have the basic structure of the website. There will be pages for the user Authentication, QR code Generation, and QR code display
- **CSS** - This will give my html pages their unique style. I'll make sure that the specific style renders well on google chrome
- **React** - Logic for user authentication, QR string and logo uploading, and QR code display. Will call service endpoints.
- **Service** - Gets the webpage icon from a 3rd party. Basic credential assembly and user authentication. Endpoint for getting a QR code given a string and/or an image. Endpoint for getting all stored QR codes for a given account
- **DB/Login** - Stores user authentication information and user QR codes
- **WebSocket** - Will push a notification message to all users when a user succesfully generates a QR code in real time
